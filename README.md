# calculator
<h2>Project Goals:</h2>
<p>Create an onscreen calculator that demonstrates all the lessons from the foundations course. The calculator should preform the 4 basic math operations of: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It should look like a calculator on screen.</p>
<h2>Skills Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to show off everything I have learned in the foundations portion of The Odin Project.</p>

<p>This project really put an emphasis on how important breaking down the project into smaller steps can be. As you can see in my code, once I got past the creation of the math functions, I started to break down each step into smaller more doable chunks, this helped me with problem solving but also it kept me more motivated to keep going.</p> 

<strong>Struggles & Roadblocks:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Regex:</strong>s this was something I had not looked into, I had to take some time looking at and understanding how it worked and how it could be applied to my project in order to search an array for multiple symbols. I plan to continue on pursuing a better understanding of Regex after this project is completed. </li>
  <li><strong>Array methods:</strong> I struggled here with understanding which array method to use when, and remembering which methods altered the original array vs returning a new copy of the array.  The solution to this struggle was referring back to my course notes and looking at examples. </li>
  <li><strong>Keyboard events:</strong> This was a new type of event I was using, as the previous projects have all been ‘click’ events. This prompted two issues for me that I had to tackle. First off understanding how keyboard events worked, this mainly was the focus of two of the extra credit pieces that allowed users to use the backspace to delete the most recent type character, and use the keyboard to enter the basic math function they wished to calculate. I got past this roadblock by going back and re-doing the lesson that focused on the keyboard events, and also by looking at other resources to help understand the events better. By doing this, it also allowed me to restructure my code into a more readable format, which made it easier for me to find errors. </li>
  <li><strong>Restructuring my code:</strong> I hit a roadblock with the extra credit part of the project. I realized that because of how my code was written to make my calculator function I couldn’t complete part of the extra credit. I solved this problem by rewriting my code, but in the process I also restructured it so that it was easier for others to follow and read. While the roadblock with the extra credit was a setback, it did lead me to noticing other flaws in my code that if I did not catch, would eventually cause the project to break. </li>
</ul>
